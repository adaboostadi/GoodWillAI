## Overview

GoodWill AI is a web-based platform designed to streamline administrative and financial workflows for organizations. The system supports four user roles—Admin, Higher Officials, Finance Team, and Planning Team—each with tailored dashboards and permissions. The platform leverages advanced AI capabilities to enhance decision-making and automate information retrieval.

- **AI Integration:**  
  - Built with Langchain and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intelligent querying and automation.

- **User Management:**  
  - Admin controls user approvals.
  - Secure registration and authentication for all non-admin roles.
